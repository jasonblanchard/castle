castle
======

These are my dotfiles. Configured with homesick: https://github.com/technicalpickles/homesick

After making changes, run `homesick commit castle` to commit and `homesick push castle` to push to master.

Once installed with homesick, the actual repo lives in `~/.homesick/repos/castle`.
